Please write a script which prints pairs of numbers if their sum is = 10 for a given collection of numbers.

For instance, if python pairs.py 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 is executed, the following is printed:
	3 + 7
	4 + 6
	5 + 5

Please take into account, that the logic of calculation has to be defined outside main block.
